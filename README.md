# MarvelVsDC

A simple attempt at exploratory data analysis, answering the following questions regarding movies relased by Marvel and DC comics

1. Total Number of Movies
2. Top 10 Highest Grossing Movies
3. Total Gross for Marvel & DC
4. Ranking by IMDB
5. Metacritic Score
6. Profit Created by the Top 10 Movies

Some of my findings can be summarized as follows:

- Marvel has released a lot more movies in comparison to DC, and therefore also has a higher gross for movies.
- 9 of the top 10 highest grossing movies are by Marvel, however, according to rankings DC seems to do better.
